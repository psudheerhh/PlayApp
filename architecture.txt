Reference Document

I have used play framework in java for delivering the solution to questions in the assessment test.

Key things to be noted:

All the models are in the models package


Record - POJO to model the data
FourSquareParsingController - code for handling the request to get the data by making a API call is put in here
RecordParsingController - code for handling the request to get the data by parsing the file is put in here
RecordController  - code for getting the Records from DB is put in this controller



TrasformToCustomResp - Interface for transforming the JSON that we get from foursquare API to CustomResponse format

There are two implementation classes for the TrasformToCustomResp interface. We can dependency inject based on type we want to use:
ConvertToCustomResp - it creates POJO for foursquare Api response and create Max2 Specific response (useful for future implementation if in cases we want to parse multiple things other than names of the places)
ParseNodeDirectly - it uses ObjectMapper to parse without creating the POJO (Useful for current scenario as we don’t have to create POJO for whole foursquare API response)

Util Classes
CommonUtil  - All the common methods for making API calls used by Controllers is put in here
ParsingUtil - All the common methods that we use for parsing the file in the Controller action methods is put in here.

DatabaseExecutionContext - custom Execution context to perform DB operations
Constants - constant used across the application

Some of the config stuff used:
HikariCP
DB datasource - default
Ebean -ORM
